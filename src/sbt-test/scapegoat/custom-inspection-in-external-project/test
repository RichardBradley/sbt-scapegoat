# This example project depends on the sibling example
# 'custom-inspection-in-subproject'.
# The inspections from that demo have been "publishLocal"ed by the build.sbt
# in the top-level project.
# The project can be built and tested:
> test
# Scapegoat should run OK:
> scapegoat
# The project has scapegoat warnings:
$ exec grep DisallowJavaDateConstruction target/scala-2.11/scapegoat-report/scapegoat-scalastyle.xml
